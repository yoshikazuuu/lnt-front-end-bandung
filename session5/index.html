        <p class="background-title">Who is Ena?</p>
        <p class="background-text">Shinonome Ena (Êù±Èõ≤ÁµµÂêç) is a third-year student at Kamiyama High School who attends
            night
            classes. She is the illustrator
            for the underground music circle 25-ji, Nightcord de., going by the alias "Enanan."</p>

                <p class="background-title">Appeareance</p>
                <p class="background-text">Ena has wide, dark brown eyes that become a gradient into beige. She has
                    short
                    brown hair with medium-length bangs swept
                    to the right. The left part of her hair is braided and tucked behind her left ear, tied with a short
                    white ribbon. Her
                    voice is sweet and airy.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex">
                <p class="background-title">Personality</p>
                <p class="background-text">Ena is an extremely strong-willed person who always speaks her mind. She is
                    harshly critical of her own work, often
                    frustrated by her lack of talent.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ena is also easily flustered and angered, and is described as a "tsundere" by Mizuki. While
                    blunt and sarcastic in
                    her words, she also has a caring and soft side which she doesn't like to admit to, especially in the
                    case with Mafuyu.
                    Ena is often the first person to lend a hand when a friend is in trouble even with her harsh
                    attitude.
